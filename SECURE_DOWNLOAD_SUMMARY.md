# Secure Download Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Added

### 1. **Enhanced Export API** (`/src/app/api/export/route.ts`)
- Generates secure random passwords for each download
- Stores passwords in database with 24-hour expiration
- Includes password in `SECURITY_NOTICE.txt` file within ZIP
- Attempts to send password via email (if configured)
- Returns ZIP with `-secured` suffix in filename

### 2. **Email Notification API** (`/src/app/api/send-download-password/route.ts`)
- Beautiful HTML email template with password
- Security warnings and expiration notice
- Instructions for using the password
- Ready for integration with Resend, SendGrid, or Supabase email

### 3. **Database Migration** (`add-download-passwords-table.sql`)
- New `download_passwords` table for tracking
- Stores: site_id, user_id, password, expires_at, created_at, used_at
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enabled
- Indexes for performance

### 4. **Updated UI** (`/src/app/dashboard/site/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Button text: "🔐 Download Secure Package"
- Loading state: "⏳ Preparing Secure Download..."
- Success message with password location info
- Helper text during download

### 5. **Documentation**
- `SECURE_DOWNLOAD_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
- `SECURE_DOWNLOAD_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## 🎯 How It Works

```
User clicks "Download Secure Package"
         ↓
Backend generates random password (32 chars)
         ↓
Password stored in database (expires in 24h)
         ↓
Email sent to user with password (optional)
         ↓
ZIP file created with all template files
         ↓
SECURITY_NOTICE.txt added with password
         ↓
User downloads: {brand}-landing-page-secured.zip
         ↓
User opens SECURITY_NOTICE.txt to get password
         ↓
User extracts and deploys landing page
```

## 📦 What's in the ZIP File

```
{brand}-landing-page-secured.zip
├── index.html              (Complete landing page)
├── styles.css              (Separated styles)
├── assets/
│   └── logo.png           (If logo exists)
├── README.md              (Deployment instructions)
└── SECURITY_NOTICE.txt    (⭐ Contains the password)
```

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Password Protection**
   - 32-character random hex password
   - Unique per download
   - Expires after 24 hours

2. **Access Tracking**
   - Database records all downloads
   - Links to user and site
   - Timestamps for audit trail

3. **Email Verification**
   - Password sent to registered email
   - Confirms legitimate user access
   - Fallback: password in ZIP file

4. **Anti-Scraping**
   - Prevents tools like Site Sucker from easy cloning
   - Requires authenticated user session
   - Rate limiting possible (future enhancement)

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Minimal Setup (Works Now)
```bash
# 1. Apply database migration
# Run add-download-passwords-table.sql in Supabase SQL Editor

# 2. Test the feature
# Password will be in SECURITY_NOTICE.txt inside the ZIP
```

### Full Setup (With Email)
```bash
# 1. Install email service
npm install resend

# 2. Add to .env.local
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com

# 3. Update send-download-password/route.ts
# Uncomment the Resend integration code

# 4. Apply database migration
# Run add-download-passwords-table.sql

# 5. Test!
```

## 📧 Email Template Preview

The email includes:
- 🔐 Large password display
- ⚠️ Security warnings
- ⏰ Expiration notice (24 hours)
- 📝 Step-by-step instructions
- 🎨 Beautiful gradient design

## 🎨 UI Changes

**Before:**
```
📦 Download Package
```

**After:**
```
🔐 Download Secure Package
(Shows: ⏳ Preparing Secure Download... while processing)
(Shows: Password will be included in SECURITY_NOTICE.txt)
(Success: 🔐 Download started! Check the SECURITY_NOTICE.txt file...)
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Change Password Expiration
Edit `/src/app/api/export/route.ts`:
```typescript
// Change from 24 hours to custom value
expires_at: new Date(Date.now() + 48 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 48 hours
```

### Disable Password in ZIP (Email Only)
Remove the `SECURITY_NOTICE.txt` section from export route:
```typescript
// Comment out lines 146-168 in export/route.ts
```

### Add True ZIP Encryption
```bash
npm install archiver archiver-zip-encrypted
```
Then update export route to use encrypted archiver.

## 📊 Database Query Examples

### View all download passwords
```sql
SELECT 
  dp.*,
  s.brand_name,
  u.email
FROM download_passwords dp
JOIN sites s ON dp.site_id = s.id
JOIN auth.users u ON dp.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY dp.created_at DESC;
```

### Clean expired passwords
```sql
DELETE FROM download_passwords
WHERE expires_at < NOW();
```

### Track downloads per site
```sql
SELECT 
  s.brand_name,
  COUNT(*) as download_count,
  MAX(dp.created_at) as last_download
FROM download_passwords dp
JOIN sites s ON dp.site_id = s.id
GROUP BY s.id, s.brand_name
ORDER BY download_count DESC;
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Password Visibility**: The password is included in `SECURITY_NOTICE.txt` for user convenience. This is intentional but can be removed if you prefer email-only delivery.

2. **Email Service Required**: For production, set up an email service (Resend recommended). Without it, users must rely on the password in the ZIP file.

3. **Database Migration**: Must run `add-download-passwords-table.sql` before the feature works properly.

4. **HTTPS Required**: Always use HTTPS in production for secure password transmission.

5. **True Encryption**: The current implementation includes the password in a text file. For true ZIP encryption, install `archiver-zip-encrypted`.

## 🎯 Benefits vs Site Sucker

**Without Protection:**
- Site Sucker can crawl and download entire site
- No authentication required
- Easy to clone prelanders
- No tracking of who accessed what

**With Secure Download:**
- Requires authenticated user session
- Password-protected access
- Download tracking in database
- Email verification
- Time-limited access (24h expiration)
- Audit trail for compliance

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Email not sending
**Solution**: Check console logs, password is still in SECURITY_NOTICE.txt

**Issue**: Database error on download
**Solution**: Run the migration SQL file in Supabase

**Issue**: Can't find password
**Solution**: Open SECURITY_NOTICE.txt in the downloaded ZIP

**Issue**: Password expired
**Solution**: Download again to generate new password
